I am an incoming Ph.D. student at Columbia University where I am privilaged to work with [Shuran Song](https://shurans.github.io/). I am interested in 3D computer vision and robot perception.

Before Columbia, I was a software engineer at [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens). I worked on the Object Understanding team, where I was fortunate to collaborate with [Harpreet Sawhney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harpreet-sawhney-2b024b28/) and [Ning Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ning-xu-5a687896/). It was with their support that I developed a passion for computer vision.

Prior to Microsoft, I was a Computer Science undergrad at Brown University. I was lucky to work with [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/~gdk/) and [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/index.html) on my honors thesis: [Teaching Robots Using Mixed Reality](http://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/ugrad/2018/gadre.samir.pdf). As an undergrad, I also enjoyed TAing introductory Computer Science courses.

I am from Louisville, KY. I love to play ultimate frisbee, run, read, and watch movies whenever I can.
